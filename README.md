Hey.
I'm search for  a creative team for long-term cooperation, who will share their quality experience.  
You will need to use SOLID concepts, design patterns, CD / CI unit tests, and well-organized workflows in your projects.
And I guarantee you that a good and strong specialist will appear on your team.

## About me.

I am an amateur PHP developer with a good knowledge base.   My knowledge is **middle** qualifications.
Since there is no production experience, the objective assessment of my knowledge is  **experienced Junior**

**What can you find out about me:**
1. My deep experience in PHP / JS starts in 2017;
2. I'm self-taught. I did not study at the institute as a programmer, did not attend specialized courses.  My knowledge base is formed from technical documentation and experiments.
3.  Knowledge in PHP:
	- PHP syntax - good knowledge;
	-  PSR specification - middle knowledge.  
	- ООП и SOLID - good knowledge.  At the stage of implementing an idea, I often write "bold" classes and "bold" methods.  In the future, I try to decompose code and share responsibility (S);
	-  design patterns - minimum knowledge. I am familiar with design patterns, but I have not designed code based on patterns.  In my case, the design of the code was formed at the stage of writing the code.
	- Unit tests- middle knowledge. Lately I've been trying to write BDD tests.  TDD tests did not write;
	- MVC/HMVC  -good knowledge;
	- composer- middle knowledge; 
	- Laravel -  minimum (basic) knowledge. 
4. Knowledge in JS:
	- ECMA Script  2015 and after - good knowledge;
	- NodeJS - minimum knowledge;
	- DOM (browsers) - middle knowledge;
5. DataBase:
	- MySql и SQLite -  middle knowledge.  
	-  MongoDB - middle knowledge. Experience 4-5 months of active use. 
6.  OpenAPI 3 и JSONSchema -   minimum knowledge. Applied several times 
8.  Code Documentation -  middle knowledge. ... I try to document all my code in PHPDoc and JSDoc. Also fill in README.md.
9.  GIT - middle knowledge;
10. Linux - User level;
11. Server administration:
	- Apache 2.4 + PHP +MySQL + OpenSSL- setting up servers for the developer's environment;
	- Ngnix - no experience;  
12. Docker - no experience;
13. CD/CI - no experience;
14. CurrentIDE - PhpStrom ;
15. English is minimal;

Knowledge qualification and evolution of code quality can be assessed by looking at my repositories [GitHub](https://github.com/ALexeyP0708).    
I ask you not to focus on the quality of the code, which you are used to writing. 
From the first time, high-quality code is written only with well-formed code patterns.

In practice, in the first place is the implementation of the idea and its concept, then comes the implementation of quality (refactoring stage). And quality takes time and resources.
